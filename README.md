# K Means Clustering Algorithm for Iris Flower Dataset

This repository contains a practice exercise for implementing the K Means Clustering algorithm on the Iris flower dataset. The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how the K Means Clustering algorithm can be used to group similar data points together based on their features.

## About the Dataset

The Iris flower dataset is a popular and well-studied dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of measurements of four features of three different species of Iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each data point in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding species of Iris flower.

## About the K Means Clustering Algorithm

K Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into distinct groups based on their similarity. The algorithm aims to minimize the distance between data points within the same cluster while maximizing the distance between different clusters.
